Predictive Models and Data Science Projects
Welcome to my repository showcasing a collection of data science and machine learning projects. Each project in this repository is designed to address a specific problem using various analytical and predictive techniques. Here’s an overview of what you’ll find:

1. Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species based on their petal and sepal dimensions.
Techniques: Supervised learning using logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

2. Unemployment Analysis
Objective: Analyze unemployment trends and factors affecting unemployment rates over time.
Techniques: Data visualization, time series analysis, and statistical modeling.

3. Car Price Prediction
Objective: Predict the resale value of cars based on various features like make, model, year, and mileage.
Techniques: Regression analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

4. Email Spam Detection
Objective: Identify spam emails using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
Techniques: Text preprocessing, Naive Bayes classification, and evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

5. Sales Prediction
Objective: Forecast future sales based on historical data, promotional activities, and market trends.
Techniques: Time series forecasting, regression models, and trend analysis.
